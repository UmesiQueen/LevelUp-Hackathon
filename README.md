# The Level Up Front Hackathon Challenge

My first attempt to participate in an online Frontend Hackathon.

## The challengeâœ¨

The challenge was to build the merchant onboarding experience by paying keen attention to details and writing pixel perfect implementations to the Figma design provided, Whilst catering for the three most popular types of Shopify merchants:

1. Mouse users
2. Keyboard-only users
3. Screen reader users

We were to create a fully responsive experience for users on these device types:

- Mobile Phones (Google Chrome Browser Only)
- Desktops (Google Chrome Browser Only)

### Challenge constraints

The solution to the challenge was limited to using **only HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript** (a file for each). No CSS or Javascript frameworks or libraries are allowed.

We were provided with the Challenge Resources(Figma Files and Assets), as well as User Stories.

> Eg. â˜‘ As a merchant, when I click on the circle checkbox (empty) on the left side of an onboarding step title, it marks that step as completed, and expands the next incomplete step. If I click again, it marks the step as incomplete. As I mark steps as completed or incomplete, I see the onboarding progress bar showing the correct progress.

### Grading Criteria

1. Screen reader usage
2. Keyboard usage
3. Figma accuracy / Pixel perfection
4. Functionality
5. Code quality
6. User experience

Overall, I had a swell time doing this. Although I hopped on the train late and couldn't get to execute all the expectations before the deadline, I was so glad I tried.

- I now know how to and value the importance of building accessible applications for all/ at least most common types of users.
- I revisited my roots - Vanilla JS ðŸ¤£
- Gained a community while at it.

I look forward to participating in more Hackathons and ACING them.
